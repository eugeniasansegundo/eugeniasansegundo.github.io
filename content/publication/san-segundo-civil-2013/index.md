abstract = "The most frequent way in which criminals disguise their voices implies changes in phonation types, but it is difficult to maintain them for a long time. This mechanism severely hampers identification. Currently, the CIVIL corpus comprises 60 Spanish speakers. Each subject performs three tasks: spontaneous conversation, carrier sentences and reading, using modal, falsetto and creak(y) phonation. Two different recording sessions, one month apart, were conducted for each speaker, who was recorded with microphone, telephone and electroglottography. This is the first (open-access) corpus of disguised voices in Spanish. Its main purpose is finding biometric traces that remain in voice despite disguise."
