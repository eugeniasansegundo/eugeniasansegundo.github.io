abstract = "Spanish and English na&#239;ve listeners judged the similarity of five pairs of Spanish speaking identical twins. Listeners rated speaker similarity in a comparable way irrespective of their L1. This is of forensic relevance in non-native earwitness evidence, as it suggests that similar listening strategies operate (i.e. holistic approach to voice quality) when stimuli are short and no other segmental cues are available for the na&#239;ve listener &#45; native or non-native &#45;to judge speaker similarity."
