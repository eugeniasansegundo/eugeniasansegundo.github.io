abstract = "Having noted a lack of oral corpora of Spanish twins' voices, we have collected a database which consists of the following malespeakers:  24  monozygotic twins,  10  dizygotic  twins,  8  non-twin  brothers,  and  12  non-twin reference-population  speakers.  Twenty-two  voice-related  studies  about  twins  have been  reviewed  in  order  to  account  for  the  average  sample  size  of  previous  twin  corpora,  as  well  as  their  data  collection  method.  Within  a forensic-phonetic  approach,  the  study  of  twins'  voices  is  particularly  relevant,  as  these  (especially  monozygotic  twins)  represent  the  most  extreme  physical  similarity  in  human  beings.  Distinguishing them is therefore a challenge in speaker identification."
