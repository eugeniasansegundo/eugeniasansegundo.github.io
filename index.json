Speech rhythm was viewed from MacNeilage’s frame/content theory. Specifically, the temporal envelope was analysed. The subjects, native speakers of Canarian Spanish, read four phonetically-balanced sentences. Five common spectral measures (centroid, spread, rolloff, flatness, and entropy) were computed from the temporal envelope of each sentence. A binomial logistic regression model was built to evaluate how well the five spectral measures can characterize speech rhythm in dysarthric speakers versus the control group. The results show that the dysarthric group present a significantly lower centroid and lower spread. Possible explanations for these results are discussed in relation to previous phonetic studies into the rhythmic speech patterns of dysarthric speakers.","tags":null,"title":"Characterizing rhythm in dysarthric speech using the temporal envelope","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo","Victoria Marrero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682892000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682892000,"objectID":"3eeb3d8d36b1cbbed8e02a0724fe95ee","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/san-segundo-efecto-2023/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/san-segundo-efecto-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"El efecto «otro acento» en una rueda de reconocimiento de voces: un estudio perceptivo en español","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682892000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682892000,"objectID":"72ff20ba7e29438473b71a277d31ff26","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/san-segundo-lafonetica-2023/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/san-segundo-lafonetica-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"La fonética forense: nuevos retos y nuevas líneas de investigación","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1682892000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682892000,"objectID":"b3103bb7210682ee3d29595ea1ccb8f2","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/san-segundo-foneticaforense-2023/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/san-segundo-foneticaforense-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Este trabajo revisa de manera crítica el ámbito de la lingüística aplicada conocido como fonética forense.

Hacia una mejor comprensi\u0026#243;n de las caracter\u0026#237;sticas fon\u0026#233;ticas que permiten distinguir voces reales de deepfakes (HowDIs: How Deepfake Is your voice)\nTITLE OF THE PROJECT (ACRONYM): How deepfake is your voice? Understanding the linguistic foundations of deepfakes (HowDIs)\nThis project aims to bridge the gap between the latest research carried out in the field of telecommunications engineering, aimed at designing automatic systems to avoid spoofing attacks, and the linguistic-phonetic knowledge that can help distinguish real voices from fake voices, helping therefore to detect videos and audios that are fake but very realistic (the so-called \u0026ldquo;deepfakes\u0026rdquo;). Although this last scientific area (that is, the linguistic area) has not yet been sufficiently explored in the aforementioned context, we consider that it has great potential when it comes to addressing one of the most important security challenges faced all over the world nowadays. We refer to deepfakes, a term used to designate videos or audios that, without being real, seem so due to an extreme and sophisticated manipulation, carried out using artificial intelligence techniques. Generally, this manipulation occurs in the facial and sound domain; in other words, what is most frequently transformed are people\u0026rsquo;s faces and voices. In particular, in the field of voice (which is tackled both by phoneticians and speech engineers), due to the growing development of deep neural networks, there is a real threat that deepfakes will create audios of such extreme realism that it will not possible to distinguish them from real voices. It is clear that if these technological advances fall into the hands of criminals, such as fraudsters, there is a serious risk of major security breaches, taking into account that access to bank accounts through voice authentication is increasingly common. These types of situations are known as spoofing attacks. However, beyond these risks, the investigations carried out in the field of deepfakes have a broader impact on society, since the manipulation of voices -of politicians, for example- to create false news is increasingly frequent. This is leading to an unprecedented loss of confidence in the media, with clear repercussions on the decisions that citizens make in political life, as shown by some recent examples (e.g. fake news in the Brexit campaign, or in the last elections presidential elections in the US). In this project we propose that the fight against voice deepfakes should be led by interdisciplinary research groups beyond the engineering teams that are currently dealing with the design of anti-spoofing attack systems. Forensic phoneticians have extensive experience in comparing very similar voices (such as the voices of twins), for which they analyze a great variety of acoustic or perceptual-type vocal parameters.The characterization of voices in Spanish can be approached from multiple angles. As a result of previous studies, it has been observed that human voices present a common denominator: high intra-speaker variation, which is due to emotional, pragmatic-contextual factors, related to the health of the speaker, etc. This type of variation is difficult to control voluntarily; therefore, it can be said that it constitutes what makes us human. In short, this project will aim to answer the question of \u0026ldquo;what makes a voice human\u0026rdquo; as a first step to be able to distinguish when we are dealing with a deepfake.\n","date":1662045149,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662045149,"objectID":"8c52a434a5f7f50ae187b0d8ff04cc30","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/project/deepfakes/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T16:12:29+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/deepfakes/","section":"project","summary":"Research project funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation","tags":["Research Projects"],"title":"How deepfake is your voice?

this talk, I will focus on a voice parameter that has been widely investigated in Forensic Phonetics, particularly in the past five years. This feature is called *voice quality* and it has two possible interpretations. In a narrow definition, it refers to the activity of the vocal folds only and it implies the acoustic analysis of sustained vowels. According to the broad definition, VQ results from a combination of long-term laryngeal and supralaryngeal features. I will start by introducing what Forensic Phonetics is and its main areas of application, in order to gain some insight into the most common methods and parameters used in Forensic Speaker Comparison, a task that forensic phoneticians are frequently requested to do. This consists in comparing the recording of an unknown offender with the recording of a suspect in order to find out whether those two voices belong to the same speaker. This introduction to Forensic Phonetics will allow me to eventually put the emphasis on voice quality as a forensic parameter. It is worth mentioning that the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) includes voice quality in its recent *Best Practice Manual for the Methodology of Forensic Speaker Comparison*. In this talk, I will mention the existence of simplified versions of the Vocal Profile Analysis scheme for the perceptual assessment of voice quality and I will highlight the importance of such simplifications, as put forward in a recent international survey on voice quality practices by forensic phoneticians and clinicians. By emphasizing the crossroad where Forensic Phonetics and Clinical Phonetics meet, I hope to create more synergies between two fields of Applied Phonetics where current interdisciplinary collaborations are already proving fruitful for both disciplines.","tags":null,"title":"Voice quality at the crossroads between Forensic Phonetics and Clinical Phonetics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633471200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633471200,"objectID":"cf18a763cadfb5c93c9523581ab8e792","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/san-segundo-pechakucha-2021/","publishdate":"2021-10-06T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/san-segundo-pechakucha-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Pecha Kucha presentation about my research experience and interests","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo","Jonathan Delgado"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630879200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630879200,"objectID":"ebf3cc16d38c3fc187804e0035be9d76","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/san-segundo-preliminary-2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-06T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/san-segundo-preliminary-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"We have conducted an acoustic-perceptual evaluation of 15 dysarthric and 15 neurologically-healthy speakers. On the one hand, speech samples were analysed with Praat (13 acoustic parameters were extracted, related to F0, frequency and amplitude variation, as well as other source and vocal tract measures). On the other hand, two raters evaluated all the voices perceptually using the Simplified Vocal Profile Analysis (SVPA), which implements a visual analog scale for each voice quality setting in an online interface. The results show, for the perceptual analyses, that (1) intra- and interrater agreement is overall very good; and that (2) the perceptual settings vocal tract tension and laryngeal tension are the most useful to characterize dysarthria. In terms of statistical modelling, most linear models were significant using only 4-5 acoustic parameters, but the specific parameters in each model depend on the VPA setting under consideration. All in all, acoustic-perceptual assessment through the SVPA seems to be an important complement to traditional assessment in dysarthria, as it provides information on the functioning of the supraglottic structures commonly affected in this type of motor speech disorder, in which the muscles used to produce speech are damaged, paralyzed, or weakened.","tags":null,"title":"A preliminary approach to the acoustic-perceptual characterization of dysarthria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo","Jonathan Delgado"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630879200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630879200,"objectID":"cf390390744a0d5accd0eb872541818a","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/san-segundo-preliminary-2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-06T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/san-segundo-preliminary-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A preliminary approach to the acoustic-perceptual characterization of dysarthria","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Yang Jun-jie","Eugenia San Segundo","Li Guo-hui","Zhang Lan-xin","Li Ya-long","Chen Gao-feng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629756000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629756000,"objectID":"6bce106fdaa99e5ed208f66a185ef7ce","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/junjie-how-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-24T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/junjie-how-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"How many people knock on the table when talking: An investigation into speakers' individual differences in hand-tapping behavior","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625263200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625263200,"objectID":"0e6b4dac452602ca80d374bb56b4b46c","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/san-segundo-panorama-2021-1/","publishdate":"2021-07-03T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/san-segundo-panorama-2021-1/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Panorama de la fonética forense actual","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622671200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622671200,"objectID":"f64ae12e65074f5c5f11784e5242dd49","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/san-segundo-maximum-2021/","publishdate":"2021-06-03T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/san-segundo-maximum-2021/","section":"talk","summary":"*Objective:* The purpose of this study was to determine whether monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins perform differently in the following measures: maximum phonation time (MPT), Maximum Expiration Time (MET) and the s/z ratio. *Methods:* Twenty-eight healthy male adults participated in this investigation: 10 pairs of MZ twins and 4 pairs of DZ twins. They were all native speakers of Standard Peninsular Spanish, recorded during 2012. Subjects were asked to sustain (1) /a/ three times and (2) /s/ also three times. In both cases, they performed this task at a comfortable pitch and loudness after maximum inhalation. All /a/ and /s/ tokens were manually labelled in Praat. Their durations were calculated and extracted with a script. MPT and MET were defined as the maximum duration of /a/ and /s/. For the calculation of the s/z ratio, /a/ substitutes /z/, as in Spanish the phoneme /z/ does not exist. *Results.* Preliminary results suggest that MPT is longer in the cohort of MZ twins than in DZ twins while MET values are very similar. Consequently, the s/z ratio in MZ twins is lower than in DZ twins.

An increased sample size would also be required in order to determine whether respiratory and glottal efficiency can be influenced by genetic factors.

For its design, we have adapted the Simplified Vocal Profile Analysis (SVPA) so that the new tool features two main characteristics: (1) the ordinal scalar degrees of the original protocol are turned into a visual analogue scale; and (2) the original paper-based version of the protocol is now a computer-based implementation. In order to assess the reliability of the new tool, five phoneticians listened to 12 different speakers and evaluated their voice quality using the proposed tool. Inter-rater agreement was then calculated using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient. The results show that high agreement was reached for most of the perceptual settings of the protocol. Yet more investigations seem necessary into the continuous nature of the perceptual dimensions making up the voice quality of a speaker. As a preliminary approach to the graphical possibilities that the visual analogue scale offers to the SVPA, we explore the usefulness of multiple dot plots and propose an adaptation of the Bland-Altman plot to be used in pairwise comparisons. In this study, these visualization techniques are tested on two pairs of identical twins.","tags":null,"title":"A computer-based tool for the assessment of voice quality through visual analogue scales: VAS-Simplified Vocal Profile Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1613602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613602800,"objectID":"4a7343d12d24688d2cf25af009035fb8","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/san-segundo-international-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-18T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/san-segundo-international-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years numerous investigations have focused on voice quality (VQ) for forensic purposes.

Important differences were found between groups, particularly regarding perceptual assessment.

Whether the ultimate goal of the VPA evaluation is the comparative description of languages or the characterization of an individual speaker, the VPA protocol shows great potential for different research areas of speech communication. However, its use is not without practical difficulties. Despite these, methodological studies aimed at explaining where, when and why issues arise during the perceptual assessment process are rare. In this paper we describe the methodological stages through which three analysts evaluated the voices of 99 Standard Southern British English male speakers, rated their voices using the VPA scheme, discussed inter-rater disagreements, and eventually produced an agreed version of VPA scores. These scores were then used to assess correlations between settings. We show that it is possible to reach a good degree of inter-rater agreement, provided that several calibration and training sessions are conducted. We further conclude that the perceptual assessment of voice quality using the VPA scheme is an essential tool in fields such as forensic phonetics but, foremost, that it can be adapted and modified to a range of research areas, and not necessarily limited to the evaluation of pathological voices in clinical settings.","tags":null,"title":"The use of the Vocal Profile Analysis for speaker characterization: Methodological proposals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo","Pedro Univaso","Jorge Gurlekian"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1564524000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564524000,"objectID":"70386ad1dfcaf9c421cad948f0e098c2","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/san-segundo-sistema-2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-31T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/san-segundo-sistema-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"In Forensic Speaker Comparison (FSC) several different parameters are commonly analysed.

The objective was to determine if the performance of the new FSC system is better than that of the baseline system. For this, three experimental designs were carried out -allowing us to evaluate the new multiparametric system in extreme conditions, as if it was a stress test-: (1) use of forensically-realistic characteristics (e.g. background noise, reverberation, intra-speaker variability, signal compression); (2) voice comparison of 12 monozygotic twin pairs; and (3) comparison of disguised voices through nose pinching.

Parametric curves (polynomials and discrete cosine transform) were fitted to the formant trajectories of the 19 Spanish vocalic sequences of 54 male speakers, comprising monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, non-twin brothers and unrelated speakers. Using the curve-fitting estimated coefficients as input to a multivariate-kernel-density formula, cross-validated likelihood ratios were calculated to express the probability of obtaining the observed difference between two speech samples under the hypothesis that the samples were produced by the same speaker and under the hypothesis that they were produced by a different speaker. The results show that the best-performing system is one that fuses the 19 vocalic sequences with a geometric-mean fusion method. When challenging the system with related speakers, the results show that MZ twin pairs affect performance but, more importantly, that non-twin sibling pairs can deteriorate performance too. This suggests that more investigations are necessary into a range of similar-sounding speakers beyond MZ twins. Several nurture aspects are highlighted as explanatory factors for the strikingly high similarity of a specific non-twin sibling pair.","tags":null,"title":"Formant dynamics of Spanish vocalic sequences in related speakers: A forensic-voice-comparison investigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"IP: Junjie Yang\nDates: 2019 - 2021\nFunder: Chinese Ministry of Education\nUndertaken activities: Acoustic analysis of twin voices; statistical analyses; dissemination of results in journals and conference presentations; mentoring of junior members of the research team\n","date":1546372398,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546372398,"objectID":"309f1efcc5eb45c1848cef2fe6503035","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/project/key-technologies-for-forensic-speaker-comparison/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T20:53:18+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/key-technologies-for-forensic-speaker-comparison/","section":"project","summary":"International project at the Shanxi Police College (Taiyuan, China)","tags":["Research Projects"],"title":"Research on Key Technologies for Forensic Speaker Comparison","type":"project"},{"authors":["Paul Foulkes","Peter French","Eugenia San Segundo","Philip Harrison","Vincent Hughes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538949600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538949600,"objectID":"4ef9c25a5042f9c4c301073caed78f7b","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/foulkes-methodological-2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-08T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/foulkes-methodological-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Methodological issues in inter-rater agreement in voice quality analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Vincent Hughes","Philip Harrison","Paul Foulkes","Peter French","Colleen Kavanagh","Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536184800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536184800,"objectID":"2a6d3f3ca2292c70fdef3ccbcae115ea","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/hughes-individual-2018/","publishdate":"2018-09-06T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/hughes-individual-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Semi-automatic systems based on traditional linguistic phonetic features are increasingly being used for forensic voice comparison (FVC) casework.

In line with this, we present a comparison of long-term measures of the speech signal to assess the extent to which they capture complementary speaker-specific information. Likelihood ratio-based testing was conducted using MFCCs and (linear and Mel-weighted) long-term formant distributions (LTFDs). Fusing automatic and semi-automatic systems yielded limited improvement in performance over the baseline MFCC system, indicating that these measures capture essentially the same speaker-specific information. The output from the best performing system was used to evaluate the contribution of auditory-based analysis of supralaryngeal (filter) and laryngeal (source) voice quality in system testing. Results suggest that the problematic speakers for the (semi-)automatic system are, to some extent, predictable from their supralaryngeal voice quality profiles, with the least distinctive speakers producing the weakest evidence and most misclassifications. However, the misclassified pairs were still easily differentiated via auditory analysis. Laryngeal voice quality may thus be useful in resolving problematic pairs for (semi-)automatic systems, potentially improving their overall performance.","tags":null,"title":"Mapping across feature spaces in forensic voice comparison: the contribution of auditory-based voice quality to (semi-)automatic system testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Foulkes","Vincent Hughes","Eugenia San Segundo","Peter French","Philip Harrison","Colleen Kavanagh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501192800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501192800,"objectID":"e7ec5728311707d6200c649b4a4e066e","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/foulkes-voice-2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-28T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/foulkes-voice-2017/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Voice and Identity: exploring the contribution of voice quality","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Athanasios Tsanas","Eugenia San Segundo","Pedro G\u0026oacute;mez-Vilda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1499724000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499724000,"objectID":"36825cda3a62020850cf27207b216a00","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/tsanas-exploring-2017/","publishdate":"2017-07-11T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/tsanas-exploring-2017/","section":"talk","summary":"Pause fillers occur naturally during conversational speech, and have recently generated interest in their use for forensic applications.

A number of reasons can explain low inter-rater agreement when evaluating whether a voice is lax or tense; among others, lack of shared internal standards by different raters as to how to interpret tension. It was hypothesized that this may have been the case in a recent study involving the perceptual assessment of 24 speakers by two raters (San Segundo \u0026amp; Mompean, 2017). Therefore, in this project several prosodic measures were extracted from the recording of each speaker. The correlation test between the perceptual ratings and the prosodic variables shows a significant positive correlation between the ratings of Rater 1 and the variable varcoM (mean intensity variability across syllables). In contrast, the ratings of Rater 2 correlate positive and significantly with two rhythmic measures related to mean consonant dura-tion. For this second rater, we also found a significant negative correlation between his ratings and a number of variables related to syllable variability, in particular nPVI-Syl (normalized Pair-wise Variability Index of Syllable durations), r = -0.490, p \u0026lt; 0.01.

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four non-pathological male speakers (12 monozygotic twin pairs) of Standard Peninsular Spanish were perceptually evaluated by two trained phoneticians using the simplified VPA (SVPA). Based on their perceptual ratings, intra- and inter-rater agreement was measured, and an index of speaker similarity was calculated not only between twin pairs but also between non-twin pairs. For that purpose, one member of each twin pair was compared with a member of a different twin pair. METHODS: Intra- and inter-rater agreement measures were tested with unweighted and linear weighted kappa. Speaker similarity was measured with simple matching coefficients (SMC). RESULTS: The results show that analysts' internal consistency was very high, whereas inter-rater agreement was found to be strongly setting-dependent. SMCs between speakers indicate that twin pairs are, on average, more similar than non-twin pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Agreement results suggest that the proposed SVPA is a reliable protocol for the perceptual characterization of VQ, and SMC results confirm that it can also be a useful tool for the assessment of speaker (dis)similarity. The extraction of a voice quality similarity index shows potential in fields like forensic phonetics, but could also be of interest in related areas of voice research and professional practice.","tags":null,"title":"A Simplified Vocal Profile Analysis Protocol for the Assessment of Voice Quality and Speaker Similarity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo","Athanasios Tsanas","Pedro G\u0026oacute;mez-Vilda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"2901d6a9a52c0c3508e1a1e4c8f2f209","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/landing/san-segundo-euclidean-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/landing/san-segundo-euclidean-2017/","section":"landing","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Euclidean distances as measures of speaker dissimilarity including identical twin pairs: a forensic investigation using source and filter voice characteristics","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo","Athanasios Tsanas","Pedro G\u0026oacute;mez-Vilda"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"8b59551f12cfcad0efbb0a79751ccab7","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/san-segundo-euclidean-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/san-segundo-euclidean-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a growing consensus that hybrid approaches are necessary for successful speaker characterization in Forensic Speaker Comparison (FSC); hence this study explores the forensic potential of voice features combining source and filter characteristics. The former relate to the action of the vocal folds while the latter reflect the geometry of the speaker's vocal tract. This set of features have been extracted from pause fillers, which are long enough for robust feature estimation while spontaneous enough to be extracted from voice samples in real forensic casework. Speaker similarity was measured using standardized Euclidean Distances (ED) between pairs of speakers: 54 different-speaker (DS) comparisons, 54 same-speaker (SS) comparisons and 12 comparisons between monozygotic twins (MZ). Results revealed that the differences between DS and SS comparisons were significant in both high quality and telephone-filtered recordings, with no false rejections and limited false acceptances; this finding suggests that this set of voice features is highly speaker-dependent and therefore forensically useful. Mean ED for MZ pairs lies between the average ED for SS comparisons and DS comparisons, as expected according to the literature on twin voices. Specific cases of MZ speakers with very high ED (i.e. strong dissimilarity) are discussed in the context of sociophonetic and twin studies. A preliminary simplification of the Vocal Profile Analysis (VPA) Scheme is proposed, which enables the quantification of voice quality features in the perceptual assessment of speaker similarity, and allows for the calculation of perceptual-acoustic correlations. The adequacy of z-score normalization for this study is also discussed, as well as the relevance of heat maps for detecting the so-called phantoms in recent approaches to the biometric menagerie.","tags":null,"title":"Euclidean distances as measures of speaker dissimilarity including identical twin pairs: a forensic investigation using source and filter voice characteristics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo","Paul Foulkes","Vincent Hughes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1481238000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481238000,"objectID":"e9aff33d24effcd0c0b82a7367e4a289","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/san-segundo-holistic-2016/","publishdate":"2016-12-09T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/san-segundo-holistic-2016/","section":"talk","summary":"Spanish and English na\u0026#239;ve listeners judged the similarity of five pairs of Spanish speaking identical twins.

Since the cepstral features in which this ASR system is based depend largely on anatomical-physiological foundations,we hypothesized that such features ought to be gene-dependent. Therefore, higher similarity values should be found in MZ twins (100% shared genes) than in DZ twins, in brothers (B) or in a reference population of unrelated speakers (US). Results corroborated the expected decreasing scale MZ  DZ  B  US since the similarity coefficients yielded by the automatic system for these speakers decreased exactly in the same direction as the kinship degree of the four speaker groups diminishes. This suggests that the system features are to a great extent genetically conditioned and that they are hence useful and robust for comparing speech samples of known and unknown origin, as found in legal cases. Furthermore, the 9.9% EER (Equal Error Rate) obtained when testing MZ pairs lies around the same value (11% EER) found in K\u0026#252;nzel (2010) with German twins.","tags":null,"title":"Automatic Speaker Recognition of Spanish siblings: (monozygotic and dizygotic) twins and non-twin brothers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"29eff7231700525b76483f8593af7cf0","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/landing/san-segundo-forensicspeaker-2015/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/landing/san-segundo-forensicspeaker-2015/","section":"landing","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Forensic speaker comparison of Spanish twins and non-twin siblings: A phonetic-acoustic analysis of formant trajectories in vocalic sequences, glottal source parameters and cepstral characteristics (PhD abstract)","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"2c58048d72b4e91000c5bb9eaebdf451","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/landing/san-segundo-forensicspeaker2-2015/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/landing/san-segundo-forensicspeaker2-2015/","section":"landing","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Forensic speaker comparison of Spanish twins and non-twin siblings: A phonetic-acoustic analysis of formant trajectories in vocalic sequences, glottal source parameters and cepstral characteristics (PhD abstract)","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"8ffa9fcf5b2e7f073affecc4354c6140","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/san-segundo-forensicspeaker-2015/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/san-segundo-forensicspeaker-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Forensic speaker comparison of Spanish twins and non-twin siblings: A phonetic-acoustic analysis of formant trajectories in vocalic sequences, glottal source parameters and cepstral characteristics (Thesis abstract)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"69ccc6378c6aacd481c39d9fbb3eb997","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/san-segundo-forensicspeaker2-2015/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/san-segundo-forensicspeaker2-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Forensic speaker comparison of Spanish twins and non-twin siblings: A phonetic-acoustic analysis of formant trajectories in vocalic sequences, glottal source parameters and cepstral characteristics (Thesis abstract)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juana Gil","Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"0922160789af217dc6450d2cb907542b","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/landing/gil-nuevas-2015/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/landing/gil-nuevas-2015/","section":"landing","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Nuevas aportaciones al estudio de la percepci\u0026#243;n del habla","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Peter French","Paul Foulkes","Philip Harrison","Vincent Hughes","Louisa Stevens"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"0184ff6799348f6be653837c5acee1fe","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/landing/french-vocal-2015/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/landing/french-vocal-2015/","section":"landing","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The vocal tract as a biometric: output measures, interrelationships, and efficacy","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":" Published as a monograph in Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes, Alicante, 2017   Please click the tags above for two abstracts in English published in Language and Law - Linguagem e Direito (tag Abstract Linguagem-Direito), and International Journal of Speech Language and the Law (tag Abstract IJSLL).

Stimuli consisted of 24 pairs of utterances, 24 pairs of words and 24 pairs of syllables. The participants were 20 female and 20 male speakers. Within each gender group, half of the participants were trained in a musical instrument and half of them were not. None of the subjects knew the three brothers whose voices were used to create the test stimuli. The results suggest that two of the three variables considered in this study (namely, stimulus duration and musical training) are significant to discriminate voices while the listener's gender is not significant.

Following Boersma and Hayes (2001), we have used the gradual learning algorithm in combination with the variation model proposed in Cutillas (2004). The results of our analysis for two Spanish female speakers show that the restrictions (as strictness bands) of their respective grammar systems overlap.

The speakers - to be compared in a pairwise fashion - were divided in four groups: 24 monozygotic (MZ) twins, 10 dizygotic (DZ) twins, 8 non-twin brothers and 12 unrelated speakers. From the extracted vowel fillers, considered long enough for a glottal analysis (around 160 milliseconds), a vector of 68 glottal parameters was created. Our hypothesis that higher similarity values would be found in the intra-pair comparison of MZ twins than in DZ twins, brothers or unrelated speakers was confirmed, which suggests that the glottal parameters under investigation are genetically influenced. This finding seems of great forensic importance, as a phonetic parameter is considered forensically robust provided that it exhibits large between-speaker variation while it remains as consistent as possible for each speaker (i.e. small within-speaker variation).","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating the forensic importance of glottal source features through the voice analysis of twins and non-twin siblings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"f22650ff30fd6d2e11d8bc7bff6c0595","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/landing/san-segundo-forensicspeaker-2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/landing/san-segundo-forensicspeaker-2014/","section":"landing","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Forensic speaker comparison of Spanish twins and non-twin siblings: A phonetic-acoustic analysis of formant trajectories in vocalic sequences, glottal source parameters and cepstral characteristics","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo","Pedro Gómez-Vilda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"5ff9bfcedbaa2e5869d8a3cf43a41dd0","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/landing/san-segundo-forensic-2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/landing/san-segundo-forensic-2014/","section":"landing","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Forensic voice comparison using glottal parameters in twins and non-twin siblings","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Juana Gil","Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"b95ba80e4f582e0713ed25fe4013f7e9","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/landing/gil-cualidad-2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/landing/gil-cualidad-2014/","section":"landing","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"La cualidad de voz en fonética judicial","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Juana Gil","Eugenia San Segundo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"da7d23b5da0e2fd7ebc3862c79a7807b","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/gil-cualidad-2014/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gil-cualidad-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"La cualidad de voz es un par\u0026#225;metro que reviste gran importancia para la investigaci\u0026#243;n y la pr\u0026#225;ctica de la fon\u0026#233;tica judicial, pese a no haber sido a\u0026#250;n suficientemente estudiado, especialmente por lo respecta al panorama bibliogr\u0026#225;fico espa\u0026#241;ol.

Dysphonic voice production may be used for biometrical speaker characterization. In the present paper phonation features derived from the glottal source (GS) parameterization, after vocal tract inversion, is proposed for dysphonic voice characterization in Speaker Verification tasks. The glottal source derived parameters are matched in a forensic evaluation framework defining a distance-based metric specification. The phonation segments used in the study are derived from fillers, long vowels, and other phonation segments produced in spontaneous telephone conversations. Phonated segments from a telephonic database of 100 male Spanish native speakers are combined in a 10-fold cross-validation task to produce the set of quality measurements outlined in the paper. Shimmer, mucosal wave correlate, vocal fold cover biomechanical parameter unbalance and a subset of the GS cepstral profile produce accuracy rates as high as 99.57 for a wide threshold interval (62.08 - 75.04 \u0026#37;). An Equal Error Rate of 0.64 \u0026#37; can be granted. The proposed metric framework is shown to behave more fairly than classical likelihood ratios in supporting the hypothesis of the defense vs that of the prosecution, thus offering a more reliable evaluation scoring. Possible applications are Speaker Verification and Dysphonic Voice Grading.","tags":null,"title":"Using Dysphonic Voice to Characterize Speakers’ Biometry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo","Pedro Gómez-Vilda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1387321200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1387321200,"objectID":"2634a8a3ae6b9e5ad40607af22f6d725","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/talk/san-segundo-voice-2013/","publishdate":"2013-12-18T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/san-segundo-voice-2013/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Voice biometrical match of twin and non-twin siblings","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Eugenia San Segundo","Pedro Gómez-Vilda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1385852400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1385852400,"objectID":"5c3b41f5ab46a8e051929cafec6d31cd","permalink":"https://eugeniasansegundo.github.io/publication/san-segundo-voice-2013/","publishdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/san-segundo-voice-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"The similarity in twins' voices has been always an intriguing issue in forensic speech matching, but has become a serious matter of research only recently.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.\u0026rdquo; #abstract_short = \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo;\nIs this a featured publication?
